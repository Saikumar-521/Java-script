/*
what is binding:
binding is the process of setting the value of 'this' keyword in a function to a specific object or context.
There are different types of binding in JavaScript:
1. Implicit Binding
2. Explicit Binding
3. New Binding
4. Default Binding
5. Advanced Binding
Each type of binding determines how the 'this' keyword behaves in different scenarios when a function is invoked.
