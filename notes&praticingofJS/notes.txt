founder of js is brenden eich
in 1995 ----------->it names is mocha------->later its name is Livescipt----------->at that time java is popular so javascript

euopean computer manfactures association--------->for standards the jslanguage ------->offical name ECMAScript-262

what is js?
--->using which we can make a web application interactive and dynamic
--->js is used to make a web application alive
--->js was developed by brendan eich in 1995
--->js became ECMA  standard in 1997-ECMA
Script

1995--------->netscape navigator
javascript engine ?

ECMAScript === js engine === interpreter

complier/interpreter
complier:
translate the entire source code of a program into machine code(or an intermediate code)before excution----------->CPU excutes the machine code
--------->once complied, programs typically run faster since they are excuted directly by the machine cpu.

interpreter:
translate the source code into machine code line-line or statement by statement at runtime and excutes immediately

questions on JS?
1) why should I learn js?
*what is JS & what can we do with it?

v8--------->combination compliation and interpretor is used for increasing the performance

*who invented js?
brenden eich
*what is the official name given to js?

ECMAScript

*what is fullstack?
frontend-back-end


*netscape navigator browser-------> first js run in this browser by brendan eich--------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in js-----> everything is object
for formatting your document install preety extension


JS is a single thread work ?-------------->JS can only excute one instruction at a time,That's why it is called single threaded.
(Synchronous) not equal to single thread
Synchronous programming means that tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other.-------
* each operation must complete before the next one begis.
* In thismodel, the program excution is blockeduntil the current task is finished.

Asynchronous----------->we can do our code into the Asynchronous using some methods like---->setTimerout

//comments in js  used for giveing information how code is works
single line comments  //----> cltr + /
multiple line comment  /**/----->shift + alt +a

what is object-oriented programming--------------> class--object

object------>object is a thing/entity that has a state and behavior------>state-----properties----------->state is represented with variables
                                                                   ----------->behavior------->actions--------->behavior is represented with function
class---------> class is blueprint to create objects

in primitive datatype------->we can store single value and print
in objects/ non primitive--------> we can store multiple value


data types:
number
int 
float number


the higest number to store in int variable is -------2^53  if we store higer number than this take only even numbers6
type conversion;
if convert from string to number use + unary operator or number methods
if convert form bitint to number use number method only the uniary + operator is not worked in that case
to assign the number to variables use number() method or directly assign number
same bigINt() also


boolean 
true,false

string:
anything that is enclosed in the single,double qoautes or in back tickes that is called string.
